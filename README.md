## 🔑 Key Insights

### 🌡 Current Temperature

* Current average temperature displayed by region
* Example: **33.8°C** (snapshot view)

➡ Helps users quickly assess real-time weather conditions

---

### 📈 Weekly Temperature Trend

* Gradual temperature decline observed during the week
* Peak temperatures at the start of the week, decreasing toward the end

➡ Useful for short-term weather planning

---

### 🌬 Air Quality Index (AQI)

* AQI Status: **Moderate (67)**
* Major contributors include PM10, PM2.5, and O3

➡ Indicates acceptable air quality with minor health concerns for sensitive groups

---

### 🌧 Rain Probability

* Rain chances range between **42% – 77%** depending on the day

➡ Supports outdoor activity and agricultural planning

---

### 🌍 Regional Coverage

* Dashboard includes **12 regions of Uzbekistan**, such as:

  * Andijan
  * Fergana
  * Karshi
  * and other regional areas

➡ Enables localized weather and air-quality analysis

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To provide a **clear, interactive environmental monitoring dashboard** that supports:

* Regional weather analysis
* Air quality awareness
* Environmental decision-making
* Data-driven planning for daily activities

---

## 📌 Conclusion

This Uzbekistan Weather & Air Quality Dashboard demonstrates how Power BI can be used to visualize complex environmental data in a clear and user-friendly way.

It delivers valuable insights into **regional weather conditions and air quality trends**, supporting better awareness and planning.
